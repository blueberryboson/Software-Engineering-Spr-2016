Find Open Classes Project: Every semester faculty to have to find open classes to put undergraduate students into.  The system doesn't allow us to find these open classes easily.  We can get a PDF of all classes, which could be converted to a word document, or a .rtf file, or a .txt file.  A nice Python program (or a Java program) using string processing and regular expressions could parse this file and produce a list of classes that were open.  In addition, it could compare it to a list of core courses only and produce a list of open core courses.
